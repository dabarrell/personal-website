      text: |-
        Teenyco aims to improve ultrasound diagnostics in pregnancies, as well as
        foster an increased connection between parent and unborn child. Through
        various visualisation and digital fabrication techniques, we are able to
        provide parents with a new way to connect with their babies. These methods
        include extrapolating meshes from 2D ultrasound images, allowing us to
        3D print tangible models.<br /><br />
        Access to the anonymised data obtained through this process also allows
        us to investigate how machine learning can be used to pick up and point
        out potential anomalies to radiologists, reducing the high rate of ultrasound
        anomalies that currently go undetected.<br /><br />
        Teenyco won the $10,000 CMB Capital 'Best Startup' award at the Wade
        Institute's Final Pitch Night, as chosen by a panel including venture
        capitalists and established entrepreneurs.

        CommunityAid is a web application which helps communities to help themselves in disaster situations.
        The application allows users to quickly understand their immediate situation, and respond to events
        during and after an emergency. It aims to improve the safety and wellbeing of those in disaster
        situations, facilitate community rebuilding, provide information about natural disaster scenarios,
        and improve targeting of aid and emergency services.<br/><br/>

        CommunityAid was initially developed at Codebrew 2017, and was then selected for the Australian
        National Finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup.<br/><br/>

        A live demo can be found at <a href="https://communityaid.barrell.me">communityaid.barrell.me</a>, and

  - title: Sentiment Analysis of Non-English Tweets
    subtitle: Cluster and Cloud Computing
    dates: April - May 2017
    info:
      text: |-
        As a final submission for a subject at the University of Melbourne, a report was produced examining the sentiment,
        and other data, of non-English tweets in Australia. These tweets were harvested and stored in CouchDB, which
        was then used to analyse the data. The results were visualised on a simple front-end, utilising MapBox and D3.js.
        <br/><br/>

        The project also focused on a fully automated deployment to OpenStack, using Boto and Ansible.<br/><br/>

        The final report can be found <a href="docs/ccc-report.pdf">here</a>, and the

        This website started as a simple portfolio, but has morphed into an

        projects.<br/><br/>

        All steps are as automated, from generation of pages with Handlebar tempates, to
        creation of Docker images and deployment to AWS EC2 Container Service.<br/><br/>
